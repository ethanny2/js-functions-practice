## Requirements
A browser or Nodejs environment to run JavaScript.

## Question Concepts 

### 1. Occurrences of substring in a String
- Comparing strings with case-insensitivity
- Using .indexOf() to find positions of substrings
- Using an offset to move the pointer to the current character when a new substring is found

### 2. Check if string is mirrored (Different from a Palindrome)
- Looping through a string and comparing both ends/indicies 
- Understanding what level of block scope "break" in JavaScript escapes from (the for loop)

### 3. Check if string sorted by ASCII decimal values
- Understanding low-level concepts like ASCII values and how each is associated with a key
- Indexing into a string and utilizing .charCodeAt() 

### 4. Longest consecutive repeating substring in a String
- Keeping track of a counter while iterating through a string

### 5. Check if Array is sorted (Using built in JS comparsion operators)
- Understanding comparsion operators and how they work on strings in JavaScript

### 6. Occurrences of consecutive pairs of elements in an Array
- Understanding how to index into an array via for-loop

### 7. Return frequency of numbers (0-10) in a resultant Array
- Can be done using a long else if; more clean with a switch case statement.(Simple understanding of conditionals)

### 8. Left-shift/Rotation of an Array
- How to extract elements from the start of an Array
- How to push elements to the end of an Array

### 9. Create addToSet() method (unique values only)
- Understanding what a set and how to check if an Array contains an element

### 10. Count occurrences of a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value 
- How to loop through a string an keep track of a counter that increments under specific cicumstances
- Similar to the substring problem but with more edge cases 



### 11. Shift all even elements in an Array so they are before any odd elements (any order).
- Understanding of divisiblity through the modulus operator.
- How to swap to indices of an Array in JS
